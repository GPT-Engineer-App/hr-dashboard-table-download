# hr-dashboard-table-download

I already have a react vite project setup . I need a HR dashboard . Already have the Login page setup . 

On the dashboard , On top the company name , provided by backend(already have the data). We need to make a table like excel on the dashboard with these fields. 

Employee name	
Employee ID	
PAN	
PRAN	
Total employer contribution
	Pension Equity Fund 1 
	Equity Contribution 1 (E)
	Pension Gsec Fund 1	
Gsec Contribution 1 (G)
	Pension CBon Fund 1
	CBon Contribution 1 (C)
	Pension AltF Fund 1	
AltF Contribution 1 (A) 

That table should be downloadable wither in csv or excel format.
